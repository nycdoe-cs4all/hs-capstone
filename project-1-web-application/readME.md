# Project 1: Create a Web Application
This project will look different depending on the language you are working in; if you are working in JavaScript or another front-end development language, it may be a website. Python, you may use a framework like Flask to create a website, as well. If you are working in Java, or something similar, it may be an app that could be hosted online. Speak with your teacher about the direction you should go.

Web Application - with our without backend, feels useful/commercial, user journey as core piece. TBD based on language, could be an app or web app etc.
